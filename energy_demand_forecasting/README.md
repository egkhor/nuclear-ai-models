# Energy Demand Forecasting for Nuclear-Powered Data Centers

## Overview
This ML model forecasts energy demand for AI data centers powered by nuclear energy, using an LSTM neural network to predict hourly consumption. It supports grid stability and Malaysiaâ€™s NETR goals.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd energy_demand_forecasting`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the script: `python energy_demand_forecasting.py`
2. The script trains the LSTM model on simulated data, evaluates performance, and saves the model as `energy_demand_model.h5`.
3. Outputs a plot (`demand_forecast.png`) comparing actual vs. predicted demand.

## Data
- Simulated hourly energy demand for one year with seasonal patterns.
- Adaptable to real data center consumption data.

## Notes
- Designed for non-critical grid integration applications.
- Developed by EGK (Isaac Khor Eng Gian), leveraging ML and xAI expertise.
