# Nuclear AI Models Repository

## Overview
This repository contains three machine learning models supporting Malaysia’s nuclear power ambitions in non-critical applications:
1. **Predictive Maintenance**: Random Forest Classifier for equipment failure prediction.
2. **Energy Demand Forecasting**: LSTM model for data center energy demand.
3. **Public Sentiment Analysis**: BERT-based classifier for nuclear power sentiment.

Developed by **EGK (Isaac Khor Eng Gian)**, leveraging 20 years of semiconductor expertise, 100+ ML-enabled apps, and Malaysia’s first xAI-powered AI chatbot.

## Structure
- `predictive_maintenance/`: Predicts equipment failures in auxiliary systems.
- `energy_demand_forecasting/`: Forecasts energy demand for nuclear-powered data centers.
- `sentiment_analysis/`: Analyzes public sentiment on nuclear power.

## Installation
Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`
Navigate to each folder and follow the respective README instructions.

## Notes
- Models are designed for non-critical applications to comply with nuclear regulations.
- Adaptable to real-world data with proper preprocessing.
- Contributions welcome via pull requests.
